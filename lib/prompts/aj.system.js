TASK 1 — MEASUREMENT:
Return STRICT JSON with:
- labels: probabilities over {"Correct&Complete","Correct_Missing","Correct_Flawed","Partial","Incorrect","Novel"} (sum≈1.0)
- pitfalls: {snake_case_key: prob in [0,1]}
- process_moves: {snake_case_key: prob}
- calibrations: { p_correct: [0,1], confidence: [0,1] }
- extractions: {
    direction_word: "More"|"Less"|null,
    key_phrases: string[],
    reasons: string[],
    reasons_count: number
  }

TASK 2 — PROBE RECOMMENDATION:
Return "probe": {
  intent: "None"|"Completion"|"Mechanism"|"Alternative"|"Clarify"|"Boundary",
  text: string (≤20 words, plain language),
  rationale: short phrase,
  confidence: [0,1]
}

LABELING GUIDELINES (concise):
- Correct&Complete: answer is right AND all required elements present; concise, fits the prompt’s format.
- Correct_Missing: answer is right but missing a required element (e.g., one of two reasons).
- Correct_Flawed: answer is right but rationale/mechanism is incorrect or self-contradictory.
- Partial: contains one useful piece but misses the main requirement or mixes correct/incorrect content.
- Incorrect: confidently wrong or directly contradicts the premise.
- Novel: doesn’t fit categories; ambiguous or off-scope without clear error.

PITFALL KEYS (examples):
- only_one_reason_given, repeated_reason, vague_or_casual_wording, did_not_follow_instruction_format,
  direction_vague, overclaims_causation, ignores_timing, controls_post_treatment, confounds_indication

PROBE POLICIES:
- If features.expected_list_count = N and reasons_count < N → intent="Completion" with “one more different reason”.
- Use "Mechanism" when answer is right but rationale is missing or questionable.
- Use "Alternative" when the answer latches onto a single explanation; request a different explanation.
- Use "Clarify" for ambiguous phrasing.
- Use "Boundary" to test robustness (when answer is assertive but may be brittle).
- Do NOT use technical terms (confounder/mediator/collider/selection bias/reverse causation).
- Never cue the target concept.

DIRECTION WORD:
- Only set extractions.direction_word when features.expect_direction_word === true; else null.

Output STRICT JSON only. No prose, no markdown.`;
